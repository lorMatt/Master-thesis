## Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

My heartfelt thanks go first and foremost to my family. Thanks for listening, for caring, and for making sure I didn’t completely lose it during these five years at university.

Many thanks to my supervisors, too, for their patience while teaching a newbie how to actually write something.

To all my friends in Terni—thanks for keeping me grounded and cheering me on, even from far away. Growing up together has been such a privilege and a gift.

To my friends in Bologna, thank you for sharing your experiences and thoughts with me. I would not be half the person I am today if it wasn't for the conversations we had between classes.

To my friends in Ippogogo, thanks for conjuring a theatre out of thin air and allowing me to take part in the lovely task of telling stories.

To my friends in Ferrara, thanks for welcoming a grumpy stranger so late in the game.

And to all my friends around the world, whether you’re at home or off on some big adventure—thanks for sharing a bit of yourselves with me.
