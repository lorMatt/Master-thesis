    "text": "Abstract\nThis study explores how local labor market structures influence public discourse on environmental policy during the energy transition. It hypothesizes that areas marked by industrial decline and a high share of non-green jobs are more likely to frame environmental debates in terms of job losses. Using computational social science methods, including natural language processing on local news articles and YouTube videos, the research analyzes whether economic exposure to the energy transition—measured by deindustrialization and non-green employment—affects the salience and polarization of environmental policy discussions.\nThe analysis compares Terni and Perugia, two similarly sized cities in Umbria, Italy, with contrasting economic histories. Terni, a former industrial hub, has experienced significant job losses and pollution, resulting in public discourse that often opposes environmental policy to employment needs. Perugia, with its service-based economy, centers environmental debates on transportation and urban development, influenced by student and advocacy groups.\nData was collected via automated scraping of local news and YouTube content, then analyzed through topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and word embeddings. Results reveal clear differences in topic salience: heavy industry dominates Terni’s discourse, while transportation is more prominent in Perugia. Environmental policy gains attention mainly when promoted by social movements and is often overshadowed by other issues. When heavy industry is discussed, environmental topics are rarely mentioned. Polarization is low, with similar sentiment toward environmental policy in both cities, except for a more positive view of natural habitats in Terni.\nAll datasets and code are publicly available, supporting transparency and further research.",

    "text": "The last decades have witnessed the rise of an interrelation, in the public debate between industrial and environmental policies. In layman terms, the discussion has often revolved around two opposite arguments: a supposed trade-off between environmental policy and economic development, thus including job security (Vona 2019). This may seem unreasonable to an academic audience for two reasons. First and foremost, there are fairly strong theoretical grounds to the claim that an energy transition would lead to an increase in labour demand at the aggregate level (Smith and Carbone 2007). This fact alone would make framing the problem as a zero-sum game irrational in the eyes of an economist. Second, to the average natural scientist, balancing concerns on occupation with the perspective of mass extinction might seem silly at best. To the workers employed in those industries which face the threat of extinction, however, the choice between job security and mitigating climate change is all but obvious. The key to explaining support for environmental policy could be found in the fear of experiencing a feeling of loss and noxious deindustrialisation (Feltrin, Mah, and Brown 2022; Jackson and Grusky 2018). This project therefore insists on the importance of analysing labour markets to explain public opinion formation around the issue of climate and environmental policy. In particular, the project aims to answer the following research question:\n\nIs public discourse on environmental policy correlated to a local economy’s exposure to the energy transition?\n\nIn the second chapter, the importance of adopting a localised perspective will be stated and discussed. The concept of loss will be defined and adapted to the specific case of environmental policy. The theoretical lens through which the present analysis of public discourse is conducted will be spelled out, before briefly discussing the arguments behind case selection.\nIn the third chapter, the two selected cases will be described and compared from a historical point of view, in order to provide the necessary context for the subsequent analysis.\nIn the fourth chapter, the sample selection strategy will be presented. The two resulting corpora will be then described in detail before defining the analytical strategy adopted to produce the results enumerated in chapter five.\nThe results will be finally discussed in the sixth chapter, in which the limitations of the present study will be also assessed, and the key findings summarised in a brief concluding section.\n\n\n\n\nFeltrin, Lorenzo, Alice Mah, and David Brown. 2022. “Noxious Deindustrialization: Experiences of Precarity and Pollution in Scotland’s Petrochemical Capital.” Environment and Planning C: Politics and Space 40 (4): 950–69. https://doi.org/10.1177/23996544211056328.\n\n\nJackson, Michelle, and David B.

    "text": "2.1 The importance of a local perspective\nClimate change is a complex, multifaceted phenomenon. Its consequences manifest in different ways across territories and regions, and are borne unequally by different groups (Calvin et al. 2023). In the most pragmatic sense, some areas may be prone to flooding, while others are subject to desertification. Through a breakdown of the impacts of climate change at regional level, Rodríguez-Pose and Bartalucci (2023) found that European cities are less vulnerable than rural areas. There is thus a consolidated consensus both in the natural sciences and in literature on the energy transition that climate change should be understood as a localised phenomenon, where each political community faces different problems and tailors its solutions to pre-existent socio-economic and environmental conditions (Pörtner et al. 2023; Smith and Carbone 2007). The latter should be considered path-dependent, as in informed and constructed by the history of a certain region. It follows that the social scientist’s approach on this topic should not fundamentally differ from that of a natural scientist. Just like the biologist takes the ecological context into account when analysing the health of a natural habitat, a sociologist or political scientist cannot forget to consider local idiosyncrasies when analysing the socio-economic conditions of an artificial one (Dunlap and Brulle 2015). This becomes especially apparent in areas whose economic activity is more clearly linked to its climate: Hamilton and colleagues, for instance, found that areas which used to thrive off of skiing suffer more acutely from the adverse economic effects of the climate crisis as compared to other, less vulnerable areas (Hamilton et al. 2003). A similar argument can be made for socio-economic vulnerability to environmental policy. A regional economic system which is based on inherently polluting activities will have to undergo more fundamental change than one whose economy is centred around green-er ones. In a context where goals and strategies are set at a higher-than-regional level, environmental policy might find some regions more ready than others. To differentiate it from vulnerability to the natural consequences of climate change, this concept will be hereinafter referred to as a local economy’s exposure to environmental policy.\nThe political outlook on climate change also appears to be geographically informed. In the most down-to-earth fashion, the occurrence of climate anomalies and rising temperature trends in a particular area have been proven to be reliable predictors of individuals’ outlook on climate change as an artificial phenomenon (Hamilton and Keim 2009; Hamilton and Stampone 2013). This makes the case for adopting a local perspective even more compelling in a study concerned with public discourse.",

    "text": "2.2 De-industrialisation and patterns of loss\nAs discussed above, the overwhelming presence of job-loss arguments in the public discussion on environmental policy is hardly explainable with the traditional tools of economic rationality, since its effects should benefit the whole population indiscriminately both in terms of occupation and health. In exposed regional economies, however, workers of brown, polluting jobs might have a harder time dismissing the notion of environmental policy as a zero-sum game, where an improvement in public health is balanced out by a decline in employment and job security.\nIn a post-industrial context, workers in exposed economies often experience noxious de-industrialisation. Noxiousness is a translation from the Italian Nocività, a word used by the Italian labour movement in the sixties to identify production-induced damage against both human and non-human life (Feltrin and Sacchetto 2021). By noxious de-industrialisation, Feltrin, Mah, and Brown (2022) identify a scenario in which job loss and toxic pollution coexist, where the old factories are still operative (and polluting), but employ a fraction of the original workforce. To the inhabitants of an area which used to thrive off of industrial activity, the post-industrial experience is one of loss and decline. As Jackson and Grusky (2018) poignantly point out, concentrated loss, as in loss attributable to a single group, can lead to its politicisation. What this means is that those active or employed in exposed economies might interpret environmental policy as a covertly distributional zero-sum game, where blue collar industrial workers lose out to urban, service-class elites, active in green, future-proof sectors of the economy. The truthfulness of the (re-) distributional claim is of little interest in this instance, although a fear of loss in exposed economies does not appear to be groundless: in Europe, the intensity of toxic pollution is still positively associated with employment and wages at the industrial level (and specifically in the energy sector), while a reduction of pollutants at facility level is associated to lower employment and wages (Bez and Virgillito 2022). Following Jackson and Grusky (2018) and their Post-liberal theory of social stratification, resentment, resistance, and retrenchment against environmental policy should be then expected from those who feel that their jobs are endangered by it.",

    "text": "2.3 Theoretical framework and research questions\nAs discussed above, in exposed economies, we expect the dominant narrative around environmental policy to be one of a zero-sum game (Jackson and Grusky 2018). The aim of this study, however, is to establish rather than explain the phenomenon at hand. The approach adopted is therefore clearly a grounded, descriptive one.\nThe central research question is thus the following:\n\nCan the characteristics of public discourse around environmental policy be correlated to a regional economy’s exposure to environmental policy?\n\n\n2.3.1 Public discourse analysis\nIn order to detect shifts in public discourse, we turn to media. This is a somewhat unorthodox approach: in stark contrast with the more consolidated practice of considering media to have an active role in shaping narratives and political concepts, they will be here thought of as responsive to public opinion on the ground. This is a rather common concept in social movements research, where issue salience and awareness are thought to be influenced by mobilisation (see, for instance: Carey, Branton, and Martinez-Ebers 2014). Classic concepts in agenda-setting theory, however, still represent this study’s theoretical core. Environmental policy will be here analysed in terms of its salience in local media (McCombs 1976). Heavy media emphasis on environmental policy (salience) will be treated as a sign of it ranking higher in personal agendas in a certain area. Its attributes, as in its sub-issues and relationship with other policy areas, will be here aptly qualified.\n\n\n2.3.2 Economic exposure\nThe concept of economic exposure (as in vulnerability to the energy transition) is here operationalised through the identification of two localised labour market conditions:\n\nHaving previously experienced industrial decline and suffered the consequences of noxious deindustrialisation;\nPresenting a prevalence of brown jobs.\n\nThe hypothesised mechanism underpinning the relationship between economic exposure and zero-sum discourse can be summarised as follows: living in an area experiencing industrial decline means being exposed to a narrative in which members of previous generations remember times when they could sustain a comparatively higher standard of living. When combined with the lack of immediate economic alternatives compatible with the green transition, this feeling could develop into a structured belief in the fact that progress towards a greener future does not, in fact, benefit anyone else other than those who already have better life chances, thus producing ubiquitous loss. Such fear of future downward mobility would then manifest itself in public discourse.\n\n\n2.3.3 Methodological pursuit\nThis study’s goal is to advance knowledge on the topic by integrating standard quantitative approaches with those of computational social science. Using the web as a data source, online news outlets and YouTube videos will be analysed through natural language processing methods borrowed from computational linguistics. Through the application and comparison of different analytical strategies, this study will offer a complete overview of the phenomenon.",

    "text": "3.1 Umbria as a case study\nTerni has a long industrial history, its identity revolving around its steel factory. After decades of decline and job loss, the factory now employs a fraction of the people it did in the 1980s, while still exerting a very negative impact on the city’s air quality. Terni is a textbook case of noxious de-industrialisation, the extensive employment losses becoming even more painful as they are the proof of multiple labour failures over decades (Portelli 2023, 2017). Perugia, on the other hand, thrives off of its long academic tradition, its economic activity being mostly centred around the service economy, hospitality and confectionery. De-industrialisation is mostly unknown to the population of a city that was simply never truly industrialised. Its expansion over the last twenty years made transportation become the main topic of political debate.\nPerugia and Terni clearly display very different characteristics in terms of the labour market conditions: the experience of industrial decline of noxious deindustrialisation so familiar to Terni’s population is completely alien to Perugia’s, where heavy industry plays an almost quantitatively irrelevant role in the local economy. Nonetheless, their polities and politics have been closely intertwined for at least half a century, due to the fact that they are the only two provincial capitals of the Umbria region. These factors make them perfect to conduct a comparative case study on.",

    "section": "3.2 Terni’s industrial history",
    "text": "3.2 Terni’s industrial history\nUp to the 1880s, Terni was a medium-sized rural town of no particular interest other than the occasional visit from English painters and poets to the nearby waterfalls or the castles along the Nera valley. Although, as stressed by Vaquero Piñeiro (2020), the area was historically no stranger to manufacture, the establishment of the Società degli altoforni, fonderie e Acciaierie di Terni (“Society of blast furnaces, foundries and steelworks of Terni”) in 1884 was a defining moment in the city’s history, turning it into a full-fledged industrial town. The steel factory underwent numerous name changes as it expanded, and was finally nationalised in the 1930s. With the steel came weapons, chemicals, electrical plants and pipe mills. The production, which initially comprised solely of stainless steel, came to include cutting-edge magnetic steel, engines, turbines, all while pulling the city toward higher incomes and better education, at the expense of air quality and intense urbanisation. Since then, Terni’s identity evolved around heavy industry. Its urban design was catered to the needs of its industry, before and after being heavily bombed during WWII due to its strategic relevance. Workers’ dwellings and guest quarters still crowd every area of the town. A bright-green, 12-ton steel press greets the occasional visitor right in front of the train station. In the city centre, a loud siren resounds every day at noon signalling the end of the morning shift at the factory.\nIn recent years, however, the town’s industrial heritage started clashing with its present. After the steel factory’s privatisation in 1994, the new German-led corporate ownership immediately exported patents to Germany and started progressively cutting down on personnel. A first traumatic event for the town was to witness Thyssen-Krupp’s decision to move the highly coveted production of magnetic steel to Germany in 2004, non-withstanding the massive protests which flooded the city (Portelli 2023). In 2012, Finnish group Outokumpu tried acquiring the whole of Inoxum (Thyssen-Krupp’s inox steel division), but was forced by the European Commission to give up Inoxum’s assets in Italy, including Acciai Speciali Terni (“Terni Special Steel”, which was then the factory’s new name) (Bellomo 2012; Meneghello 2012). After looking for a buyer for two years to no avail, Outokumpu gave AST back to Thyssen-Krupp, which then decided to downsize it in order to sell it more easily (TerniOggi 2013). To this end, Lucia Morselli (whose nickname was already la tagliateste, the axewoman) was appointed CEO, with the explicit mandate of dramatically cutting down on the workforce. This sparked an unprecedented struggle between the ownership and the workforce. The tension became unsustainable, with all-out strikes being called by every union, and Morselli being even detained in her own office a whole night by protesters (Ugolini 2014; UmbriaJournal 2014). The result of the 2014 struggle, however, was considered by many an utter and complete loss for unions and the workforce. Morselli offered the protesters “compensation” (equal to the unpaid salary for the time they spent on strike), which most workers accepted (Portelli 2023).\nThe personnel of a steel factory that used to employ over 10000 people up to a few decades ago, now amounts a mere 2300 units (“AST: ARVEDI AST” 2025). The industry’s adverse effects on public health, however, did not falter one bit. We can consider Terni to be a textbook case of noxious deindustrialisation, as Feltrin, Mah, and Brown (2022) define it, since widespread job loss came with no reduction in toxic pollution. The historical presence of three waste incinerators (of which only one is currently operative) unsurprisingly contributes in fuelling a considerable amount of spontaneous public health and environmental activism (Toni 2024; TerniToday 2020). From the 2010s onwards, a wide range of local pressure groups emerged: one movement (No Inceneritori, “no incinerators”) became especially popular and influential, while the high school students at the head of Terni’s Fridays for Future branch assumed a prominent role in its national organisation. Although the COVID19 pandemic put a noticeable dent in the city’s grassroots political activity, this moment of its recent history is still fresh in Terni’s collective memory. The ubiquitous feeling of loss generated by the city’s industrial decay in Terni’s population, joined with its recent mobilisation around environmental policy, makes it a perfect case to be here analysed.",

    "text": "3.3 Perugia as a comparison case\nAfter centuries as part of the papal state, Perugia’s economic history is essentially one of stagnation up until the 20th century. In 1922, Hotel Brufani was the starting point of the fascist March on Rome (Albanese 2006). This made Perugia suddenly become a symbol to the newborn regime, which financed significant embellishments to the city. Its industry, however, remained largely underdeveloped. The city’s marginal strategic importance meant that it was mostly spared by Allied bombers during WWII.\nThe city of Perugia is also home to one of the Europe’s oldest universities (Università di Perugia, founded in 1308), as well as to the University for Foreigners (Università per Stranieri di Perugia, UNISTRA) (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica 2020). Perugia’s rich cultural heritage was a decisive factor in 1970, when it was chosen to become capital of the newborn Umbria region.\nIts economy nowadays is mostly based on the service economy, driven by festivals and large cultural events such as Umbria Jazz and the Journalism Festival. Although heavy industry does play a (quantitatively marginal) role in non-urban areas in the province of Perugia, manufacture-related economic activity in the city’s immediate vicinity pertains mostly to the confectionery and textile sectors. Notable examples of the like are Perugina’s headquarters and Nestlè’s main Italian branch, as well as Luisa Spagnoli’s textile plant.

    "text": "4.1.1 Transcribing YouTube videos\nYouTube has long been home to a rich and diverse collection of communicative content. Containing both structured press reports by traditional news outlets and bystanders’ contributions, it proves extremely valuable in obtaining an overview of public discourse that is not just limited to what professionals and insiders think or write. Since, for the purpose of the present study, we are interested in what are the most visible opinions or points of view, we could even take advantage of YouTube’s own retrieval system. The videos included in the corpus were selected through automated querying. A Python script was set up to cycle through a set of keywords associated with each of the two cities. Every video was then converted to audio and transcribed using OpenAI’s Whisper API (OpenAI 2022). This method, however, presented a few critical difficulties, connected to the nature of the medium itself. First of all, not all videos identified by the queries were relevant to the object of this study. Keywords connected to the biosphere and ecosystems were often linked to videos catered to tourists, as they overlapped with the image of Umbria as Italy’s green heart, which has nothing to do with environment policy per se. In other cases, the match between title and keyword was completely coincidental. For instance, the keywords “spazi verdi” (green areas) matched with a video essay about renovating Terni’s old theatre, Teatro Verdi. Another problem was that the quality of audio recordings was often very poor, and the dialogue delivered in the local dialect. This is equally true in the cases of demonstrations and press conferences. Professional politicians tend to drift from a linguistic register to the other, as well as between standard italian and Umbrian dialect, within even a few sentences of the same speech. Steel workers, on the other hand, tend to use very common idiomatic expressions such as me ne volevo anna’ via (“I wanted to leave”), or ce stanno a pija’ pe’ lu culo (“they’re screwing with us”), which Whisper was not able to transcribe adequately. The simplest (although definitely time-consuming) solution was manually clean the data, preparing it to be digested through natural language processing.\n\n\n4.1.2 Scraping local news articles\nMore traditional textual media was not overlooked. Three on-line media outlets were chosen to be part of a second corpus:\nCorriere dell’Umbria is an established regional newspaper, available both on-line and in print. Due to its sheer size, it has become somewhat of a staple in local press, notwithstanding its relatively young age (it was founded in 2007). Its articles prove particularly useful to a comparative study of this sort, as two of its six newsrooms are based in Perugia and Terni.\nTerninrete and Perugia Today are some of the oldest purely on-line newspapers in Umbria (founded respectively in 2009 and 2011). Embracing the fast pace of internet-based communication, they tend to publish short, rapid-fire articles. As will be discussed in a few paragraphs, this clearly impacts the quality of sentiment analysis results: fast journalism tends to be closer in tone to news agency flashes, as in more neutral in their word choices. Their responsiveness, however, is of great use in investigating a topic’s salience.",

    "text": "4.2 The corpora\nTwo corpora were built: the first comprises of 530 transcriptions of YouTube videos selected through keyword querying, the second comprises over 150000 articles published by three major on-line news outlets. Although we concede that the tone and topic composition of public discourse might differ from what can be read in the press or found on YouTube, it would be reasonable to expect that news outlets would have commercial reasons to mirror what is talked about “in the streets”, and that on-line, decentralised media platforms (like YouTube) could offer some, more or less direct, insight into public discourse.\n\n4.2.1 YouTube\nAs Figure 4.1, the distribution of the videos’ upload date is skewed towards more recent results. The number of usable videos in Perugia is also considerably higher than those in Terni. While the difference between the number of videos per city is easily explained through population and the vastly different amount of political activity (Perugia being the regional capital), the distribution of videos over time could offer some insight on the salience of each topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Umbria Press\nThe second corpus in this study comprises of articles from three on-line local newspapers: Terninrete, PerugiaToday, and Corriere dell’Umbria1. The first two are linked to the cities of Terni and Perugia, respectively, as their articles refer strictly to these two cities. Corriere dell’Umbria, on the other hand, is a regional news outlet, with separated newsrooms for the two cities. This was taken into account, and the articles divided accordingly.\nThe corpus’ composition is represented in Figure 4.2. A few of its features are evident to the eye: first of all, PerugiaToday is by far the most prolific news outlet of the three, with more than 125000 articles published. In general, the two fast-journalism outlets (PerugiaToday, Terninrete) flood the corpus with information, making the couple hundreds of articles from the Corriere almost disappear.",

    "text": "4.3 Analytical strategy\nThis study must be understood as one of exploratory nature. Its aim is not to explain a phenomenon, rather to establish its existence (Merton 1987). After a thorough description of the corpus, it will focus on two dimensions of public discourse: salience and polarisation. The tools employed to do so are here explained and compared.2\n\n4.3.1 Putting ideas in context\nExamining the context in which a word is placed is paramount in understanding the different ideas to which it is connected. KWIC (KeyWords In Context) is probably the most basic approach to this task: by simply querying a keyword, one can retrieve its immediate context and qualitatively assess it. The R package quanteda provides the researcher with a very simple interface to do so (Benoit et al. 2018).\n\nRanking words\nBeing able to rank words in terms of their relative importance to each document is a very useful tool to dissect a corpus. The standard method to do this is a simple statistical measure called tf-idf. The index is decomposable in two parts, term (relative) frequency and inverse document frequency. For a term “t” and a document “d”:\n\\[\n\\text{tf}_{t,d} = \\frac{\\text{frequency of term } t \\text{ in document } d}\n                       {\\text{total number of terms in document } d}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{idf}_t = log_{10} \\frac{\\text{total number of documents}}\n                             {\\text{total documents with term } t}\n\\]\nTf-idf is computed as \\(\\text{tf-idf}_{t,d} = \\text{tf}_{t,d} \\cdot \\text{idf}_t\\). By finding the highest tf-idf in each document or topic, one can qualify the context in which a concept or construct lives.\n\n\nFinding meaning between words\nOccurrences within the corpus can be represented as relational data, allowing us to build networks of words. Using bigrams as a unit of analysis, the relationships between words will be analysed and dissected graphically (Pedersen 2024a, 2024b).\nA relatively new approach used in text retrieval and mining is word embeddings. A very basic explanation of what word embedding means would be finding a numerical representation for each word in a corpus (Jurafsky and Martin 2025). What a word embedding model does is basically finding a point in a multidimensional space representing the meaning of each word relative to all others. The distance of each word in this semantic space can be then understood as a measure of their difference in meaning. Word embeddings are often used as a featurisation step for supervised classification models. In this study, however, they will be used mostly as a retrieval device, aiding us to find the words which are closest to pre-identified keywords relating to environmental policy.\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Sentiment analysis\nTo acquire insight on the tone of public discourse around environmental policy, dictionary-based sentiment analysis was conducted. In very pragmatic terms, this means joining a dictionary of positive and negative words with the text contained in the corpora, then analyse the frequency of matches. Although this kind of sentiment analysis can be seen as a rather crude instrument, it can still prove useful in exploring the corpora (Silge and Robinson 2017). The biggest obstacle encountered while working on this section of the study was the difficulty in finding a suitable dictionary. While dictionaries for the English language are more than abundant, acquiring one for Italian is no simple task. Although some extremely valuable work was conducted by Basile and Nissim (2013) more than ten years ago, their dictionary (SENTIX) requires PoS tagging, which was not possible to perform on the corpora in this study. The solution was to use the multilingual lexicon published by Chen and Skiena (2014). As is often the case with dictionary-based techniques, some minor tweaking was necessary. The word rifiuto (“rubbish”), for instance, was listed as negative, since it can be used as an insult when referring to a person. Of course, being our topic of interest connected to waste management, the word had to be excluded from the dictionary altogether.\n\n\n\n\nBasile, Valerio, and Malvina Nissim. 2013. “Sentiment Analysis on Italian Tweets.” In, 100107.

    "text": "5.1.1 Salience\nThe first question to be answered is: how much do people talk about environmental policy in Umbria? Is it salient at all? And then again: when was it more salient? To answer these questions, simply counting the amount of documents in which terms connected to environmental policy occur is the simplest, but probably most effective strategy.\nThe amount of videos retrieved per city varies drastically from a query category to another. As one would expect, numerous videos related to heavy industry can be found about the city of Terni. Their amount peaks in 2015, when the protests climaxed, then drop immediately the next year only to peak again in 2022, when the Arvedi group bought the steel factory from Thyssen-Krupp (Terni in Rete 2022). Shifting from foreign to Italian property was a very conflictual topic.\nSimilarly, transportation is a very hot topic in Perugia. The videos in this category tend to be very positive short documentaries about good practices in sustainable transportation, especially around 2023. A considerable peak can be detected in 2021, year in which the Bus Rapid Transfer (BRT)1 service was established, requiring considerable investment and urban rearrangement. Sustainable mobility became more salient in Terni recently, due to new cycling infrastructure being under study. A peak in 2017 was caused by the news of a considerable investment by the municipality in bus transportation.\nWaste management tends to be generally more relevant in Terni, home of three incinerators. The discourse around them became particularly heated in 2020, when one of them was finally shut down (Tuttoggi 2020).\nFinally, the salience of environment- and nature-related posts in Terni was apparently influenced by the relatively crowded Fridays for Future protests in 2019. The movement’s popularity prompted local research centres to publish Sentieri and Mal’aria (Zona et al. 2019; Legambiente 2019), two very influential studies on air quality in the area, and local politicians to take on the problem. The same thing cannot be said for Perugia, where the results of environment-related queries comprise mainly of videos catered to tourists.\nAt a first glance, environmental policy seems to be more politicised in Terni than in Perugia, and its salience linked to social movements’ success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Tone and polarisation\nAt a superficial level, sentiment values in each category seem to be fairly balanced between Perugia and Terni. Looking at individual keywords, however, reveals more accurate insight. The videos retrieved with the “Industry” query show an interesting discrepancy: the ones connected to more general terms, such as industria (industry), or even acciaieria (steel factory) are markedly positive. It is only when one specifically looks for the exact name of the steel works in Terni (Acciai Speciali Terni - AST) that one gets polarised results. This is due to the fact that the more general keywords tend to match to political press releases, which are usually characterised by an either artificially neutral or markedly positive tone. The only exceptions are the few videos taken during protests, displaying very negative sentiment values. The transportation category in Perugia offers some evidence in the opposite direction: more general queries about buses retrieve mostly negative videos about the current state of public transport, whereas querying a specific project (BRT) retrieves enthusiastic political speeches about new public investment. Waste management in Terni is especially interesting, the number of videos about the incinerator with positive and negative sentiment being almost exactly the same.\n\n\n\n\nDictionary-based sentiment analysis on YouTube videos, computed as ratio of positive over total matches per video\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Co-occurring topics\nIn general, we can confirm that environmental policy is more polarised and politicised in Terni, as even the sentiment computed on the basic query “environment” is extremely polarised, as opposed to Perugia, where videos collected with the same query are clearly positive. The problem of air quality seems to drive negative sentiment on environment-related topics in Terni.\nThe issue of insufficient air quality in Terni is clearly connected to the noxiousness of its industrial activity. However, when videos talk about industry, they almost never mention environmental policy. If one searches for videos about industrial activity in Terni, they will hear absolutely no mention of its effects on the environment. Nevertheless, a significant portion of the videos talking about the environmental conditions of the same town mention industrial activity at least once.",

    "text": "5.2 Analysing the UmbriaPress corpus\nDue to the nature of the data source, the quality of the text contained in UmbriaPress is considerably higher than that of the YouTube corpus. Together with its much bigger size, this means that more sophisticated modelling can be a viable option. The analysis still begins with keyword-based retrieval and counting, to investigate salience. An exploration of how environmental policy is defined in the corpus was made possible by treating co-occurring tokens as nodes of a relational database and training a word-embedding model. The tone of public discourse around environmental policy was analysed through dictionary-based sentiment analysis.\n\n5.2.1 Salience\nConsistently with what was found in previous analyses, the salience of transportation and industry follow very different paths in Terni and Perugia. A keyword-based retrieval returns pretty stable results in Perugia, where environmental policy comes under the spotlight in 2019, following the success of Fridays for Future, only to then yield its spot back to transportation, the main topic of discussion in the city. The situation in Terni is more erratic, each topic falling in and out of fashion way more easily.\nInterestingly enough, the co-occurrence pattern detected in the YouTube corpus is partially confirmed by this second chunk of the analysis. In Terni, 22% of the articles containing terms connected to Environmental policy also include Industry-related terms. This relationship is not completely symmetrical: the articles in which Industry and Environment-related terms co-occur represent merely 15% of those in which Industry-related tokens appear. This connection is way less significant in Perugia, where the percentages never reach 10%. Transportation and Environment are also less often connected in Perugia than in Terni. This might offer a hint about how environmental policy is discussed in the two cities: Perugia shows a more compartmentalised situation, where each topic is treated individually; whereas in Terni, environmental policy is often connected to other topics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 From salience to meaning\nThe relationship between words may help us in discovering both the definitions and connotations of certain words in our corpus. Representing the co-occurrences of significant terms and their immediate neighbours as relational data is a very valuable technique in this sense.\n\nBigram networks\nThe terms with the most connections, both in Terni and Perugia, are those relating to waste management. Interestingly enough, the word “waste” (rifiuti) is connected to “pollution” (inquinamento) in Perugia, but not in Terni.\n\n\n\nBigram relationship graph\n\n\n\n\nWord embeddings\nAfter splitting the data in two sub-corpora, one for each city, a word-embeddings model was able to represent words as points in two multi-dimensional spaces, one for each sub-corpus. Performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the values associated to relevant terms in each one lets us read them in a topographic representation, the nearest words being more closely related semantically.\n\n\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) of word embeddings in the sub-corpora containing respectively all articles published in Terni and in Perugia\n\n\nA first cluster could be identified in the Terni subcorpus around industry. (Heavy) industry in Terni is connected to polluting emissions and toxic waste. “Waste incinerator” (inceneritore) is instead found at the top of the representation, together with the words “ecosystem”, “reuse”, and “pollution”. This might explain the asymmetry in co-occurrences between the two queries “Environment” and “Industry”: while some areas of environmental policy (namely air pollution) are connected to industrial activity, waste management is treated separately.\nThe same cannot be said for Perugia, where “pollution”, “emissions”, “reuse”, and “waste” all coexist in the otherwise lonely top-right corner, while waste management is closely related to transportation, and industry-related terms seem to float without an apparent order.\nThese results contribute to explain the differences in salience and politicisation of environmental policy between the two cities. While the perugini see the environment as a coherent, unified topic of discussion, the ternani clearly mark a difference between free-standing policy areas, such as civilian waste management, and those connected to the noxiousness of economic activity, such as air quality and toxic waste.\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Sentiment analysis\nThrough dictionary-based sentiment analysis, an exploration of the tone in each of the three main topics analysed is possible. At a first glance, no real difference can be identified between the two cities, despite a certain variability between topics being present.\n\n\n\nDistribution of the difference between positive and negative word count divided by the total, visualised by topic and city.\n\n\n\nRestricting the corpus\nA first element to be taken into account is the differences in tone across newspapers: the fast-journalism outlets Terninrete and PerugiaToday tend to have a very neutral tone, due to the adoption of a very short format and the subsequent shallowness of their content.\n\n\n\nDistribution of the difference between positive and negative word count divided by the total, visualised by topic and newspaper\n\n\nBy restricting the corpus only to the articles published on Corriere dell’Umbria, one can easily see how sentiment values become more erratic: articles being way more negative in Terni than in Perugia in general, but especially when talking about environmental policy. However, the articles driving the negative tail of the distribution are, for the most part, related to single episodes or individuals’ behaviour (e.g. illegal dumps in the countryside).\n\n\n\nDistribution of the difference between positive and negative word count divided by the total, visualised by topic and city (sample restricted to articles published on Corriere dell’Umbria)\n\n\nDue to the extremely small size of the resulting sample, however, it is necessary take these last results without a grain of salt. The only takeaway from this last chunk of the analysis is that future research should take the type of journalism into account at the moment of compiling a corpus.\n\n\nContextual sentiment\nBy retrieving the tokens found immediately before or after terms connected to environmental policy, one can get a feel for where these keywords appear, as in their context in the overall text. By performing sentiment analysis on these contextual tokens, we can infer how environmental policy is conceived by the public in each city.\nThe sentiment appears generally more negative in Terni, which is hardly surprising considering that it has the regional record for the worst air quality, and overly complicated waste management conditions. Terms connected to ecology and nature, however, are markedly positive in Terni. A possible explanation could be an idealisation of nature as opposed to the noxious urban environment.\n\n\n\nSentiment values computed on KWIC - trigrams centred around relevant keywords\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComune di Perugia. n.d. “REALIZZAZIONE DELLA LINEA BUS RAPID TRANSIT (BRT) - INFRASTRUTTURAZIONE CORRIDOIO PIEVAIOLA - SETTEVALLI (LINEA CASTEL DEL PIANO - FONTIVEGGE).” https://pnrr.comune.perugia.it/progetto/realizzazione-della-linea-bus-rapid-transit-brt-infrastrutturazione-corridoio-pievaiola-settevalli-linea-castel-del-piano-fontivegge/.\n\n\nLegambiente. 2019. “Mal’aria 2019, il rapporto annuale annuale sull’inquinamento atmosferico nelle città italiane  Legambiente.” https://www.legambiente.it/comunicati-stampa/malaria-2019-il-rapporto-annuale-annuale-sullinquinamento-atmosferico-nelle-citta-italiane/.\n\n\nTerni in Rete. 2022. “Terni: Arvedi ha acquisito l’Ast, nasce così un Gruppo da 7,5 miliardi di euro.” https://terninrete.it/notizie-di-terni-terni-arvedi-ha-acquisito-l%E2%80%99ast-nasce-cosi-un-gruppo-da-75-miliardi-di-euro/.\n\n\nTuttoggi. 2020. “Terni, Chiude l’inceneritore Di Maratta | ’Esulta’ La Città.” https://tuttoggi.info/terni-chiude-linceneritore-di-maratta-esulta-la-citta/559558/.\n\n\nWickham, Hadley, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. 2023.

    "text": "6.1 Discussion\nThe salience of environmental policy displays rather different trajectories in Terni and Perugia. Its distribution over time follows social movements’ and interest groups’ success rather closely in Terni, while it seems rather independent from other policy areas in Perugia. This emerges from the analysis of both the YouTube and UmbriaPress corpora: Environmental policy in Perugia holds a stable place in public discourse, while its salience seems more issue-oriented in Terni.\nTopic co-occurrence adds a significant piece to the puzzle: a larger portion of public discourse around environmental policy in Terni is related to the noxiousness of industrial activity, both on YouTube and in online news articles. The opposite, however, is not true. While the proportions of what we could call topic overlap is somewhat stable in Perugia, they are almost completely one directional in Terni: though articles and videos about the environment trace a connection with industrial activity, articles and videos about heavy industry do not mention environmental policy whatsoever. This asymmetrical relationship is further substantiated by a semantic analysis of the corpus. The overlap is not only identified in terms of term occurrence in the corpora, rather it shows even as a coexistence of terms connected to air quality and industry in the same semantic space.\nThe emerging picture is that of environmental policy as a highly politicised topic in Terni. This makes its salience fluctuate together with the popularity and success of social movements and interest groups who centre their political activity around climate change or environmental policy. This was especially the case between 2017 - the year in which the relevance of anti-incinerator mobilisations peaked - and 2019, when Fridays for Future came under the spotlight.\nThese actors’ tendency to connect it to industrial noxiousness is reflected in the media, but industrial activity seems to be discussed without ever taking environmental concerns into account. This feeds back to Vona’s claim that job security is of utmost priority even for those who suffer the most from the adverse effects of toxic pollution (Vona 2019).\nDifferences in tone between between Terni and Perugia are subtle and nuanced. They appear mostly negligible when analysing news articles as a whole, but become rather interesting if one restricts the analysis to the keywords’ immediate context. This kind of analysis unearths surprisingly high sentiment in Terni around ecology-related keywords, and generally low values in every other one. This might hint at an idealisation of nature as opposed to a noxious urban environment.",

    "text": "6.2 Limitations\nThis study has a series of limitations. First and foremost, the retrieval techniques employed here employed are rudimentary. While quick and computationally cheap, keyword-based techniques are inherently prone to error. Future developments of the present research might benefit from a more “sophisticated” approach to text retrieval, i.e. a classification model trained to classify news articles and press releases based on their content. Second, the data collection process directly influences the results of text analysis. Each different language variety included in a sample of local political communication has a series of idiosyncrasies, especially in terms of tone. What this means is that in order to accurately assign a sentiment value to a chunk of text, it would be necessary to take into account the political alignment and stylistic habits of at least every news outlet. Finally, and most importantly, this study does not advance any explanatory claims. Its role is paving the road for future contributions to define the causal chain linking patterns of loss to the support for environmental policy.",

    "text": "6.3 Conclusion\nEmpirical results highlight an interesting connection between salience and exposure. When faced with a trade-off between job security and environmental concerns, the public’s priorities seem to lie with job security. This is certainly consistent with an interpretation of public discourse around environmental policy centred off patterns of loss, although the way in which it manifests in media is different than expected. Salience (or rather, its absence) appears to be more telling than tone. The most distinctive trait of Terni’s public discourse is its utter disregard of environmental concerns when discussing industrial planning.YouTube videos concerning industrial policies were, in fact, completely void of information on environmental policy. In the same corpus, however, a connection between toxicity and industrial activity can be identified. Additionally, “nature” as an idealised concept has an extremely positive connotation in a (formerly) industrial town like Terni in comparison to the “baseline” case of Perugia. In the context of this study’s proposed framework, this could be interpreted as a way to avoid what is perceived as a zero-sum game. What is left for future research to ascertain is whether it is, in fact, a fear of loss that causes these differences in the connotation of public discourse, and to investigate the subsequent connection between public discourse and electoral results, as well as public opinion formation.\n\n\n\n\nVona, Francesco. 2019. “Job Losses and Political Acceptability of Climate Policies: Why the ‘Job-Killing’ Argument Is so Persistent and How to Overturn It.” Climate Policy 19 (4): 524–32. https://doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2018.1532871.",

    "text": "B.0.1 Tokenisation\nDepending on the task at hand, different preprocessing methods were used. In all use cases, the corpora needed to be split into simpler linguistic units, or tokens. This process, known as tokenisation, can be carried through with a plethora of different techniques. The predominant approach in this study is rule-based. This method entails identifying the set of grammatical rules defining the ways to signal the end of a word and the beginning of another. Once this first stage of desk research is done, the only problem left to tackle is that of translating the rules in machine-readable form, so that a computer can divide long-form text into words (or sets of words). In many western languages, for instance, blank space divides one word from the next, and sentences are divided by punctuation (e.g. full stops, question marks, and so forth). In this specific case, a tokeniser designed for the English language was manually adjusted to Italian punctuation, using the tidytext package (Silge and Robinson 2016). More advanced, machine-learning techniques were also tested. Taking advantage of spacyr, a wrapper around the Python package spacy, a pre-trained tagging and tokenising model was also implemented. At the price of immensely higher computational demands, this method promises much richer results, complete with PoS (Part of Speech) tagging and even entity recognition. Even at a first glance, however, the results appeared unreliable in more complicated tasks, and indistinguishable from simpler approaches in simpler ones. This approach was therefore abandoned, in favour of tidytext’s less demanding methods.\nThe last aspect of tokenisation to be taken into account is defining what a token is. In this study, tokens will be defined as either individual words or bigrams (two consecutive words). The reason for including bigrams in the analysis is that a relational database of co-occurring words might be more informative, especially in the case of dictionary-based analyses.\n\n\nB.0.2 Deleting unnecessary content\nAfter tokenisation, the corpora were stripped of all unnecessary content. This includes the more or less obvious punctuation and numbers, but also all words which have no real value to the analysis. There are many words which we use in passing, but add no semantic value to the text. All words which do not contribute in defining a document’s meaning and topic are called stopwords. The corpora were all matched with a dictionary of Italian stopwords, using the stopwords package (Benoit, Muhr, and Watanabe 2021).\n\n\nB.0.3 Stemming and lemmatisation\nEspecially when using dictionary-based text mining methods, stemming is a common pre-processing step. It entails turning words into stems, as in only keeping their roots instead of their conjugated or declined form. An obvious case in which this would be useful is verbs: the Italian translation for “to eat”, mangiare, can be found in the conjugated forms mangio, mangi, mangiarono, mangerà, and so on, which can all be reduced to the stem mang-. There are, however, very common cases in which a verb’s conjugated form disregards the infinitive form’s root. This is the case, for instance, of the verb andare (“to go”), whose conjugated forms include vado, vai, vanno. A solution to this is adopting a more sophisticated approach called lemmatisation. It consists of automatically recognising a word’s dictionary form, and assigning it to each token. Once again, this task is hardly a simple one for a computer to take on, so it tends to be rather demanding in computational terms. An attempt was made at the early stages of this study to adopt lemmatisation, with very unsatisfactory results.
